# Adapter Pattern

![Adapter Pattern](adapter-pattern.png?raw=true)

1. The client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface

2. The adapter translates the request into one or more calls on the adaptee using the adaptee interface

3. The client receives the results of the call and never knows there is an adapter doing the translation
